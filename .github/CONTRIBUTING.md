## Developing
All that is needed to work with this project is [Node.js][nodejs-url], [git][git-url], and your favorite editor or IDE, although we recommend [VS Code][vscode-url].

### Getting Started
To start working on this project:

Clone the repo, change into the directory where you cloned the directory, and then run install the dependencies.  

```sh     
git clone https://github.com/swellaby/vscode-python-pack.git
cd vscode-python-pack 
npm i
```

### Tests
We have a few tests that validate the extension has the expected attributes. The tests are written using [Mocha][mocha-url] with [Mocha's TDD interface][mocha-tdd-url]. Make sure you add/update tests accordingly if you change the extension. The tests are located in the [test/][tests] directory

Run the tests:
```sh
npm test
```  

### Linting
This repo uses [eslint][eslint-url] for linting. You can run [eslint][eslint-url] at any time by executing the npm `lint` script:

```sh
npm run lint
```  

### Submitting Changes
Swellaby members should create a branch within the repository, make changes there, and then submit a Pull Request. 

Outside contributors should fork the repository, make changes in the fork, and then submit a Pull Request. Check out the [GitHub Forking Projects Guide][fork-guide-url] for more info.

#### PR Validation
When you create a Pull Request to merge changes, the [PR Validation Build Job][ci-pipeline-url] in Azure Pipelines will be triggered automatically to run test and lint checks. 

## Publishing
Once changes are merged into the master branch the [CI Job][ci-pipeline-url] will be triggered automatically. Once it passes the [CD Pipeline][cd-pipeline-url] will be triggered automatically which will notify the maintainers and request maintainer approval. Once a maintainer approves the updates they will be automatically published to the marketplace.
